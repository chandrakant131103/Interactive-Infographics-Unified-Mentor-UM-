<!-- 
charts integration -->
Chart.js Integration: Loaded via CDN to avoid local dependencies. The bar chart is configured with custom colors for each energy source and a y-axis starting at zero for accurate representation.
Data Management: Data is stored in a JavaScript object for easy access and updates. The updateChart function dynamically regenerates the chart based on the selected year.
Tooltip Implementation: Chart.js's built-in tooltip feature is customized to display energy consumption in TWh, providing clear additional information.
Animation: Chart.js animations (1-second duration with easeOutQuad) make transitions smooth and visually appealing.
Testing: The infographic was tested on Chrome, Firefox
I have used charts for cdn as it is free to use library
